            <h1>Tinker Thursday Name Plate (Terminal Style)</h1>
            <p>After following the tutorial during the first session we were encouraged to redesign a version based off our own interests. I took in the overall shape and it reminded me of the computers from games like Fallout and shows such as Loki, I decided to try and merge the design with the parameters of the original name plate layout.</p>
            <p>I am so pleased with how it turned out, especially as my experience with Fusion 360 is practically nil, a big thank you to the Edgy-AF instructors for showing me the ropes!</p>

            <h3>My insights</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Fusion 360 is not very intuitive and its controls can be unforgiving to novices like me.</li>
                <li>Merging the Fusion 360 files with Paint 3D to add colour to the finished result was something I never thought to try!</li>
                <li>Interested to see how something like this prints on both FDM and SLA printers.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Reasons why we should build this</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Would like to see the full fledged version assembled complete with electronics.</li>
                <li>And also....Fallout! I've played every version of the game series to date and it instills so much happy nostalgia!</li>
            </ul>
